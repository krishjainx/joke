**JKM**

This module will roundhouse kick some humor into your Linux kernel. Do not underestimate its power.

**Features**

- Automatically delivers a Chuck Norris joke to the kernel log every 20 seconds. Because Chuck said so.
- Write anything to /dev/joke and Chuck will tell a joke to lighten the mood. Chuck's humor is the best medicine.
- Makes your computer vastly more awesome. Computers cower before Chuck Norris.


**Installation**

To install, loudly proclaim "Chuck Norris rules!" three times while facing Texas. The module will build itself out of respect for Chuck.

Okay fine, here are the boring steps:

```
git clone https://example.com/chuck_norris_module  
cd chuck_norris_module
make 
make install
```

Chuck gets angry if you try to ``make clean``, so don't even go there.

``Usage``

Once loaded, sit back and enjoy the jokes flooding your kernel logs. Or get on Chuck's good side by writing to /dev/joke.

**Uninstallation**

DO NOT attempt to uninstall this module without Chuck's permission. He has taken a liking to your computer and decided to stay. If you try to remove him against his will, your CPU may explode out of fear. You have been warned.

**Warning - seriously!**

This out-of-tree module is dangerous and should not be used irresponsibly. With great power comes great roundhouse kicks to the face. You must show Chuck Norris the proper respect.
